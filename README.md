# Mandrill-Reproductive-Seasonality

In this repository, we will find data and scripts used in a paper written by Jules Dezeure, Marie J. Charpentier and Elise Huchard, about the evolution of reproductive seasonality in a wild population of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx). 

You will find the excel file 'TABLES', where the datasets used in this study are presented, and the R code script called 'Script_Total' where the codes used in this study are presented (and annotated).
